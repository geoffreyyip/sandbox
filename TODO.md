Dear Geoffrey,
Kindly find below the details on the coding assignment. The assessment for the assignment would be done based on completeness of the assignment as also code readability and maintainability.
Please note that there is no time limit, except that we expect you to get it to us within the next 24 hours. We only expect the most basic level to be fully complete; the further levels are for you to have something to keep going with and challenge yourself on, should you choose to do so.

The challenge:
In React, taking as much time as you want,

1. Basic: Create an app with a text-area in which you can input blocks of code (e.g. javascript) and it will tell you whether or not the code has balanced parentheses, including edge cases where there are the same number of forward- and backward-facing parentheses, but they are not in the right order, like the string ‘))((‘. On failing inputs, it should have some kind of clear red warning displayed; on passing inputs, a green acceptance message.

2. Slightly advanced: have it work with curly braces {} and square brackets [], still managing problematic edge cases like the string '{(})', which should not pass.

3. More advanced: have it identify and point out visually which line the mismatched brace / bracket is on.

4. Master: include a syntax highlighting library to automatically highlight / color the code blocks.

5. Mind-blowing: have the user be able to choose which language to highlight according to and support a minimum of 3 programming languages.

Your 24 hours maximum starts now. You are free to use online resources like Google, Stack overflow, and even basic React app templates to help you get started quickly, but we expect the main logic (described in the requirements above) to be your own.

Best of luck and thank you for your time and effort!
